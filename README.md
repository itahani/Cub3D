## 🚀 Overview ##

CUB3D is a reproduction of DOOM's raycasting system using only C language. Focus on memory handling and the use of raycasting to render a 3D graphic display.
I made the personnal choice of rendering a minimap on the top-left corner to help the user see where their avatar is situated on the map and which direction they're facing. The green rays are the rays I cast to help me create the 3D effect from the user's perspective.
